## Introduction to Programming (Python) - Projects 

##### These are my 3 final projects in Python for the class: "Introduction to Programming", taught by Professor Valeria Herskovic. These were also my very first programming projects. I took this class in 2013 at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC) during my Bachelor's degree.

##### In this repository, I've included one folder for each project. Each folder has a PDF file with the description of the project, my report and code (.py). In the case of the third project, there is also an HTML file in which the class called "Escenario" and its methods are described (this class was extremely important for this project). 

##### At the present moment, all files are available in Spanish only.
