## Video Poker Game

##### My first project in Python! :D The video poker game project focused on: loops, variables, arithmetic and boolean expressions, functions and control flow (no OOP yet!).

##### The game had an interactive graphical interface (GUI) which let the user play video poker according to the rules of the game, which are detailed in the PDF file included in this folder. Also, in this PDF document, the 8 winning combinations are described in Table 1 on page 3. In Table 2 on the same page, the prizes are shown as well. Prizes were based on the winning combination and the amount of poker chips that the user bet. The game also allowed for prize duplication as explained in the same PDF file (page 2).

##### For the development of this project, we were given a folder with 56 .gif files of cards (face up and face down) + a file called pokerGUI.py. This file included the definition of a class named "Application" which had several methods that are explained in the PDF file on pages 4 and 5. These methods allowed for user-code interaction through the GUI, so for instance there were methods which created changes on the GUI or methods that retrieved information from the interface (based on user input). One notable example is related to the buttons clicked by the user (each button is represented internally by a number). 

##### An example of the GUI can be found in the PDF file on pages 4, 5 and 6. 

##### The folder with the .gif files and the pokerGUI.py file are not posted here since I did not develop them.

##### Finally, the brief report included here details the main challenges of the project for me. The main challenge was learning how to play poker since at the time I didn't know how to play.
